# DDA Algorithm

1. Start
2. Functin(x1,y1,x2,y2) given
3. Delta x = x2-x1 and Delta y = y2-y1 
4. Declare Steps equal to 0
5. if |delta x| > |delta y| then steps = delta x else
   steps= delta y
6. Declare x-increment = deltax/steps and y-increment = deltay/steps
7. Plot (x1,y1) after rounding off
8. X1 = x1 + x-increment and y1 = y1+y-increment
9. Loop for steps number of times
10. stop
